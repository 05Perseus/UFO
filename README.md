## *The Goal and Methodology*
### In this project we wanted to bring data regarding extra-terrestrial sightings out into the light. We displayed an article introducing our work and the topic and diplayed a data table for people to see. 

---
## *How do we use the datatable?*
### There are five different ways you can filter the data to better analyze what is happening. Our filters include:
1. Date: the date the incident took place
2. City: the city in which the event happened
3. State: the state in which the event happened
4. Country: the country in which the event happened
5. Shape: the shape of the sighting

## *Summary*
We understand there are some limitations with the finished product. One main drawback is shapes in the table are not always true shapes. Sometimes the are just listed as 'uknown' or 'changing'.

However, there are definitely a few things that we can do to make things better!

1. Wrap the comment text. This would help to make the table more narrow.\
2. We could clean up the comment text. There are a few examples of odd symbols that can make the data hard to interpret.

With these two extra steps we could make this site an even better resource for those people who are curious about our place in the universe!
